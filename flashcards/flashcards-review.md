# Flashcards - RemNote

This section is regarding doing flashcards every day for 30 minutes to improve my fundamental knowledge. Additionally this is to provide time tracking for flashcards.

## Time Logs for Each Flashcard Session

### Week 1-2 Foundations and Data Structures (Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists)
- - **Key Topics**: String MDN Instances RemNote flashcards, Arrays Iterative Methods RemNote flashcards
- **Time Spent**: X hours X minutes
- **Reflection**: 
- ` string.chartAt(number)`  -> returns the character at the specified index
- `indexOf()` means to find the index
- `string.includes("")` -> checks the string if it contains the substring -> returns true or false
- `string.substring (index, index)` -> extracts the characters from index to index (not inclusive of end index)(essentially UP TO that index)
- `String("XXXX")` -> creation of a string with that in it
- `string.split("XXX")` -> splits the string into an array using the "XXX" as the delimiter ("XXX" is a string)
- `string.replace("what is in the string", "what you want to replace it with")` -> replaces the FIRST occurrence of that string VS. string.replaceAll("XXX") replaces all the instances
- `" "` -> a string literal containing a single whitespace character
- `string.match(/[a-e]/g)` -> finds all matches of characters in the range in the [] in the string
- using `indexOf(0)` -> example will return where the number 0 is found in the string NOT the index 0
- `string.split("")` -> splits the string into an array of individual characters
- To combine individual string characters to concat use the operator +
- Array iterative methods:
- `array.filter(callback(currentValue,index,array))` -> filter() formula
