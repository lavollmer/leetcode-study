### 1. **Problem Description**:
- **Brief summary**: 
    - Describe the problem in your own words, including the input, output, and the goal of the task.
    - Example: *"Given an array of integers, return the indices of the two numbers that add up to a target value."*

---

### 2. **Key Concepts**:
- **Data Structures Used**:
    - Arrays, Hash Maps, Stacks, Queues, Linked Lists, etc.
- **Algorithmic Techniques**:
    - Sliding Window, Two Pointer, Backtracking, Dynamic Programming, BFS/DFS, Divide and Conquer, etc.
    - Example: *"This problem uses the sliding window technique to efficiently find the longest substring without repeating characters."*
- **Common Patterns**:
    - Look for repeating patterns across multiple problems.

### 3. **Solution Approach**:

- **Step-by-step Explanation**:
    1. **Initial Thoughts**: Explain how you approached the problem. Was it straightforward or did it require some deeper thought?
    2. **The Algorithm**: Provide a detailed explanation of your algorithm, breaking it down into clear steps.
        - Example: "For the Two Sum problem, I first iterate through the array, checking if the complement (target - current number) is already in the hash map. If so, I return the indices; otherwise, I store the current number in the hash map."
    3. **Code Walkthrough**: If you've already written the code, explain how each part of the code fits into the overall solution.
    
    Example:
    ```javascript
    def two_sum(nums, target):
        hash_map = {}  # Create an empty hash map to store numbers and their indices
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            complement = target - num
            if complement in hash_map:
                return [hash_map[complement], i]  # Return indices of the two numbers
            hash_map[num] = i  # Store the index of the current number
    ```

---

### 4. **Time & Space Complexity**:
- **Time Complexity**:
    - Explain how you determined the time complexity.
    - Example: *"Since we only iterate through the array once, the time complexity is O(n)."*
- **Space Complexity**:
    - Explain the space usage.
    - Example: *"The space complexity is O(n) due to the hash map storing up to n elements in the worst case."*

---

### 5. **Edge Cases**:
- **What Edge Cases to Consider**:
    - Think about and list any special cases that could break your solution or require a different approach.
    - Example: *"If the array has fewer than two elements, return an error or handle that case gracefully."*
    - Example 2: *"Consider when the target sum might be 0, or when all elements are the same."*
    
- **How to Handle Them**:
    - Provide solutions or ways you accounted for edge cases.
    - Example: *"I checked if the array length is less than 2 at the start and immediately returned an error for invalid input."*

---

### 6. **Takeaways**:
- **Lessons Learned**:
    - What did you learn while solving this problem? Did you pick up any new techniques, patterns, or tricks?
    - Example: *"This problem helped reinforce the use of hash maps for solving problems in constant time."*
    - Example 2: *"The sliding window approach can be applied in various string-related problems to improve time complexity."*
    
- **Improvement Areas**:
    - Were there any areas in your solution that could be improved (e.g., more efficient, more readable, or better complexity)?
    - Example: *"In future solutions, I could consider optimizing for space by using fewer data structures."*

### Example for **Two Sum Problem**:

```markdown
## [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)

### 1. **Problem Description**:
- **Brief summary**:
    - Given an array of integers and a target integer, return the indices of the two numbers that add up to the target.

---

### 2. **Key Concepts**:
- **Data Structures Used**:
    - Hash Map (for quick lookups)
- **Algorithmic Techniques**:
    - Hash Map, One-pass algorithm
- **Common Patterns**:
    - Hashing, Pair matching in arrays

---

### 3. **Solution Approach**:

- **Step-by-step Explanation**:
    1. Create an empty hash map to store the numbers we've seen and their indices.
    2. Iterate through the array:
        - For each element, check if the complement (target - current number) is already in the hash map.
        - If yes, return the indices of the current number and the complement.
        - If no, store the current number and its index in the hash map.

    3. **Code Walkthrough**:
    ```javascript
    def two_sum(nums, target):
        hash_map = {}  # Create an empty hash map to store numbers and their indices
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            complement = target - num
            if complement in hash_map:
                return [hash_map[complement], i]  # Return indices of the two numbers
            hash_map[num] = i  # Store the index of the current number
    ```

---

### 4. **Time & Space Complexity**:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), because we are iterating through the array only once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), due to the space required for the hash map to store up to n elements.

---

### 5. **Edge Cases**:
- **What Edge Cases to Consider**:
    - What if the array contains fewer than two elements?
    - What if the target is 0 or negative?
- **How to Handle Them**:
    - Ensure that the array length is checked before performing any operations.

---

### 6. **Takeaways**:
- **Lessons Learned**:
    - Using a hash map to store values while iterating through the array allows us to check for complements in constant time.
- **Improvement Areas**:
    - I could optimize my code further by checking for negative values earlier in the iteration.
