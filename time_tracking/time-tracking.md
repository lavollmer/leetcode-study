# LeetCode Problem Time Tracking

This file is designed to track the time spent on each LeetCode problem. By logging the start and end times, one can monitor how long one spends on each task and improve time management.

## Time Tracking Table

**Example**

| **Problem Name**           | **Start Time** | **End Time** | **Time Spent** | **Difficulty** | **Notes/Reflections** |
|----------------------------|----------------|--------------|----------------|----------------|-----------------------|
| [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/) | 2024-11-10 10:00 AM | 2024-11-10 10:45 AM | 45 mins        | Easy           | Used hash map for O(n) solution. Improved speed by reducing unnecessary iterations. |
| [Reverse Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/) | 2024-11-11 11:00 AM | 2024-11-11 11:30 AM | 30 mins        | Easy           | Learned recursive solution in addition to iterative approach. |
| [Median of Two Sorted Arrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/median-of-two-sorted-arrays/) | 2024-11-12 1:00 PM  | 2024-11-12 2:15 PM | 1 hour 15 mins | Hard           | Struggled with binary search. Needed to revisit array partitioning strategy. |

## Time Logs for Each Problem

### **[Problem Name]**: [LeetCode Link]

- **Start Time**: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM AM/PM`
- **End Time**: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM AM/PM`
- **Time Spent**: X hours X minutes
- **Difficulty**: Easy / Medium / Hard

#### **Solution Approach**:
- Describe your approach in solving the problem. Include any techniques, algorithms, or data structures you used.

#### **Challenges Faced**:
- What problems or roadblocks did you encounter? How did you overcome them?

#### **Reflection**:
- What did you learn from this problem? What could you have done differently to improve your time or solution?

### **Example:**

#### **[Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)**

- **Start Time**: 2024-11-10 10:00 AM
- **End Time**: 2024-11-10 10:45 AM
- **Time Spent**: 45 minutes
- **Difficulty**: Easy

##### **Solution Approach**:
- Used a hash map to store numbers while iterating through the array. For each element, checked if the complement (target - current number) was in the map. This approach ensures O(n) time complexity.

##### **Challenges Faced**:
- The problem was relatively straightforward, but I had to remind myself to handle cases where the target sum might be zero or negative.

##### **Reflection**:
- This problem reinforced my understanding of hash maps. I should continue practicing more problems involving hash maps to solidify my understanding of their applications in algorithmic problems.

### **How to Use This Template**:

1. **Track Time**: For each problem you solve, record the **start time**, **end time**, and **time spent** in the table.
2. **Log Problem-Solving Process**: Under each problem, provide a detailed breakdown of your **solution approach**, **challenges faced**, and **reflections**.
3. **Monitor Improvement**: As you solve more problems, look for patterns in how long it takes to complete problems of various difficulties, and assess your progress over time.

### **Additional Notes**:

- **Time Tracking Frequency**: You can decide whether to track every problem or only the ones that you find challenging. Either way, tracking time will help you become more efficient.
- **Review Patterns**: After a few weeks, look back at how your time spent on problems improves. Are you getting faster with practice? Are certain types of problems taking longer? This will help you identify areas of improvement.
